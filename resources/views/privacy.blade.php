            Privacy Policy
        </div>
        <p>
            Jake Breen built the MGMSE app as an Open Source application and is hosting it on Userface.me. MGMSE known as the SERVICE, is provided by Jake Breen at no cost and is intended for use as is.

            This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, processing, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the Service.

            If you choose to use the Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

            This policy is only applicable to the Service provided directly by Userface.me.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-title">
            What Data Does The Service Collect?
        </div>
        <p>
            In order for the Service to function we store your Internet Protocol ("IP") address when you a host a multi-player server.

            We also store non-unique data such as your player name and latency.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-title">
            How Do You Use My Data?
        </div>
        <p>
            Your data is given out to other users of the Service in order to directly connect with your multi-player server.

            For the sole purpose of creating web widgets to display multi-player server statuses, this information may also be shared with individuals through Application Programming Interface ("API") access.

            If you have concerns about third party processing of your data, please refer to the <b>Restricting Third Party Data Processing</b> section.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-title">
            How Do You Store My Data?
        </div>
        <p>
            For the duration of your multi-player server and 10 minutes after you discontinue the multi-player server we store the data in memory.

            Non-unique data will be stored as long as you're on a multi-player server.

            We also may store your data in Logs. They are used solely for fixing and diagnosing problems with the Service, and will be deleted automatically after 4 days.

            Individuals with Application Programming Interface ("API") access may hold your data for longer.

            If you have any concerns about third party processing, please refer to the <b>Restricting Third Party Data Processing</b> section.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-title">
            Restricting Third Party Data Processing
        </div>
        <p>
            If you wish to exclude your multi-player server from third party API processing, you can do so in one of two ways.

            - Add [NT] to your multi-player server's name field.
            - Email me at the address in the <b>Contact Us</b> section with your multi-player's server address and proof that you own the address.

            Due to the nature of non-unique data we can't verify and remove this data on request. If you are concerned we recommend you stop using the Service.
        </p>
